Steganography is a technique that can hide code in plain sight, such as within an image file. Often just referred to as stego, the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text — inside a “carrier” message — means malicious actors can use this technique to compromise devices just by hosting an image on a website or sending an image via email.
